# Face Finder

Face Finder is a PERN stack web application that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a pciture. React.js serves as the front-end, Node.js as backend server with Express.js and PosrtgreSQL database for data storage (credentials, images scanned counter, etc). The user's rank gets upgraded every time user tries to detect a face in a picture.

## How to use the app

Steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open your terminal and change directory to client directory(front-end) --> `cd ./client`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Open new terminal and change directory to server directory(back-end) --> `cd ./server`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Now you can either:

        1. Add your own Clarifai API key directly in the `controllers/image.js` to connect to Clarifai API (line 6)

        2. Add your own database credentials directly to `server.js` (line 19)

    **In this case you can move `dotenv` and `config` from the project.<br>
    ** You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/).

    #### OR (recommended)

        1. Make .env file in server directory

        2. Initialize 4 variables in .env file

            NODE_ENV=development
            PORT=3000
            CLARIFAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD_HERE

7. Run `npm start` in both terminals you opened at steps 2 and 4 (server and client direcotry terminals, if you closed them do steps 2 and 4 again).
